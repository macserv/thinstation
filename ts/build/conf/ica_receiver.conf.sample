#                                                              e.g. in the configuration files:

#                                                              The address is the /discovery address, e.g.
#                                                                   ICA_RECEIVER_STOREFRONT_DEFAULT='https://storefront.mycompany.com/citrix/mycompany/discovery'
#
#ICA_RECEIVER_RECONNECT_ON_LOGON                               true or false. Corresponding to the GUI option. If true, sessions are reconnected to when the user logs on to the Citrix Recever / StoreFront
#ICA_RECEIVER_RECONNECT_ON_LAUNCH_OR_REFRESH                   true or false. Corresponding to the GUI option. If true, sessions are reconnected to when the user logs on to, or clicks Refresh in the Citrix Recever / StoreFront
#ICA_RECEIVER_DISPLAY_DESKTOPS_IN_FULLSCREEN                   true or false. Corresponding to the GUI option. If true, starts all sessions in full screen mode.
#ICA_RECEIVER_SHARED_USER_MODE                                 true or false. Google it... If you don't know it you probably don't need it.
#ICA_RECEIVER_FULLSCREEN_MODE                                  0: Windowed (default).  1: Full-screen.  2: Full-screen, with taskbar exposed.
#ICA_RECEIVER_SELF_SELECTION                                   true or false. Google it... If you don't know it you probably don't need it.
#
#ICA_RECEIVER_AUTOSTART                                        true or false. If true the Citrix Receiver application is autostarted
#                                                              at boot (after configuration is completed). The result is that the user
#                                                              gets a login screen to the directly at boot. Recommended to have
#
#ICA_RECEIVER_CLEAR_CREDENTIALS_WHEN_SESSION_LAUNCHED          true or false. If true, the users credentials are cleard afther he/she
#                                                              have launched their first session. This increases security on the Thinstation client.
#                                                              Otherwise: if the user logs on to the Receiver and launches a session, and leaves or disconnects
#                                                              the session, his/hers credentials are still logged on to the Receiver and anyone could simple start (logon)
#
#ICA_RECEIVER_CLEAR_CREDENTIALS_AFTER_SESSION_ENDS             Same as ICA_RECEIVER_CLEAR_CREDENTIALS_WHEN_SESSION_LAUNCHED, but instead of
#                                                              clearing the session directly after the first session starts, the credentials are cleard
#                                                              X minutes (ICA_RECEIVER_CLEAR_CREDENTIALS_CHECK_INTERVAL) after the last session has ended.
#                                                              This makes it easier for the user since he/she can then close sessions and easily start them
#                                                              again directly (within the time timeout limit) without having to logon.
#
#ICA_RECEIVER_CLEAR_CREDENTIALS_CHECK_INTERVAL                  Numeric value, default if not defined is 5. The check interval (timeout) used
#                                                              by ICA_RECEIVER_CLEAR_CREDENTIALS_WHEN_SESSION_LAUNCHED and ICA_RECEIVER_CLEAR_CREDENTIALS_AFTER_SESSION_ENDS
#
#ICA_RECEIVER_STOREFRONT_STOREBROWSE_CONFIGSELFSERVICE_EXTRA_1   Gives you the possibiliy to add your own extra configuration for storebrowse
#                                                                You can have as many commands you like, just use ..._EXTRA_2, ..._EXTRA_3 etc.
#                                                                It simply runs storebrowse --configselfservice ICA_RECEIVER_STOREFRONT_STOREBROWSE_CONFIGSELFSERVICE_EXTRA_1
#                                                                Example:
#                                                                ICA_RECEIVER_STOREFRONT_STOREBROWSE_CONFIGSELFSERVICE_EXTRA_1="MySetting=True"
